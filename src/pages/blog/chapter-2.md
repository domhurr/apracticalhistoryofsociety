### Labourers’ rights



Population numbers soared during the medieval period (1000-1350), thanks to an increase in the intensity and productivity of the work done by labourers and land-clearers, who at that time were no longer treated as a divided and partly servile labour force. From the estimates available, western European population numbers more than doubled between 1000 and 1500: from 20 million to 50 million. The population living on what is now France would have grown from 6 to 15 million, in the UK from 2 to 4.5 million, in Germany from 4 to 12 million and in Italy from 5 to 11 million. This is a big change compared to the previous millennium, when from 0 to 1000 AD the population appears to have stagnated around 20 million total souls.



Around the turn of the first millennium, all literary and ecclesiastical texts show that slavery was still very present in western Europe. At the end of the 11th century, slaves and serfs still represented a significant proportion of the populations of England and France. According to the Domesday Book (land inventory commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086), the proportion of the population which was either a slave or a serf ranged from 10% to 25%, depending on the county.



Towards 1350, however, slavery was almost completely gone in western European territories, and serfdom seems to have mostly disappeared, at least in its harshest forms (in practice, there is a continuum between the different forms of slavery, serfdom and free work, so it is difficult to be perfectly precise on this point). A more robust recognition of the legal status of labourers, of their civil and personal rights as well as their rights to property and mobility, gradually emerged between 1000 and 1350.



### Taxation



In France, tithing (money paid to the Church) was a tax which was collected (until the French Revolution) on the produce of land and animal husbandry, with the rate generally being between 8% and 10% of the value of the crop, usually paid in kind (i.e. if your crop was grain, you paid in grain). Tithing, which was requested by the Church, was applied to all lands, including those of the nobility, unlike tallage (*la taille*) which was a separate tax that was imposed by the reigning monarch and for which nobles were exempt. The tithe was paid directly to ecclesiastical organisations, with complex rules determining how they were to be split between parishes, diocese and monasteries. During the 8th century the Carolingian regal and nobiliary leaders in power at the time made this payment compulsory (the Carolingians were a Frankish dynasty founded by Charlemagne’s father -- *Carolingian* comes from *Carolus* which is latin for Charles, as in Charlemagne, which means Charles the Great).



During the 16th and 17th centuries, the monarchy was not getting enough revenue from taxation to meet its needs, and therefore started to sell rights to certain administrative and regal positions, such as tax officer, paymaster, registrar of deeds and official documents, various certifications related to the development of markets and the circulation of goods, etc, which were either newly created or historically run by the nobility.

There was conflict between the old nobility “of the sword” and the new holders of these various public offices, who were accused of having abused of the Crown’s bad financial position to obtain special rights, public revenue and even noble titles, by using their favourable financial positions which mostly came from mercantile activities, which the old nobility saw as being beneath them.



### Counting people



Previously to the institution of a proper census in France, the number of hearths (family groups sharing the same roof) was sometimes counted, but never the number of people, and this only in certain provinces, and in any case without any homogenous information on the orders, professions, statuses or classes corresponding to each of these hearths. The first properly national censuses only started to be organised in France from 1801, and even then it was a relatively rudimentary count of the total population. It’s only in 1851 that we start to see individual forms and the first records of citizens by name which then allowed the possibility of sorting this data by age, sex and profession. It seems obvious today that the census is an indispensable tool for the state to know about its people and function properly, but don’t forget that such an elaborate data collection mission requires a capacity for organisation, adapted transport methods and also a desire to know, measure and administer -- these conditions arise from a specific politico-ideological process and do not arise on their own.



### Being recognised as noble



The fact of being a noble rested more with being recognised as such by local peers the further back in time we go. In the medieval age, a noble was one who “lived nobly”, which is to say with sword in hand, without having to partake in degrading activities (i.e. commercial) to maintain his or her status. As a general rule, a merchant purchasing an estate could not be considered noble and was only exempt from tallage (the tax not applied to nobles) after several generations, if his son or grandson was able to show that he lived nobly. In practice, this was essential a case of recognition from the other noble families nearby.



### Population progress from 1380 to 1780



The population of the kingdom of France went from (according to the available estimates) about 11 million around 1380, to 22 million around 1700, and 28 million by 1780. By comparison, England counted 8 million souls around 1780, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland around 13 million, and the United States of America (recently independent) barely 3 million (including slaves). In the 17th and 18th centuries, France is by far the largest country in the West in terms of population, which probably explains why the French language played an international role during the Age of Enlightenment (18th century), and the massive impact the French Revolution had on neighbouring countries and on European history.



### Clergy size reduction in the last 500 years



The clergy in France has reduced massively in number between 1660 and the present day. 260,000 (out of 19 million, i.e. 1.5%) vs 20,000 today (out of 65 million, barely 0.03%). The representation of the religious class is fifty times weaker in the 21st century vs the 17th century.



### Decline of the nobility of the sword



In 1627 the Crown decreed that maritime commerce was no longer dishonourable for gentlemen, a decision which was extended to banks and manufacturing in 1767. The gradual process of the unification and monetisation of elites seems to have started already in the 17th and 18th centuries, just as the numbers of the traditional noble class started to enter a decline.



During the 18th century, the noble class experienced a decline in the number of children per couple, and a rise in the celibacy of second-born children. At the same time, we observe in France and in other European countries a tendency to concentrate the transmission of property on the first-born, similarly to the English nobility, even though practises in successorship in France and elsewhere in Europe had historically been more diverse. This trend also follows an increase in nobility in the clergy: at the beginning of the 17th century, they accounted for 63%, then 78% at the end of the 17th before reaching 95% in the 18th century.



### Overall ownership of land before the French Revolution



Around 1780, the nobility and clergy account for approximately 1.5% of the total population of France, but held about 40-45% of the land: 25-30% for the nobility and 15% for the clergy, with strong variations between regions (5% in some and 20% in others). If we include the capitalisation of the ecclesiastical tithe, the total holding of land rights reaches 55-60% (the tithe is not strictly property ownership, but could be interpreted as such since it infers a quasi-permanent collection of what is produced on the equivalent tracts of land).



### The impact of the Revolution and Restoration on the nobility



The following graph shows, statistically, the drop in the link between nobility and wealth in Paris between 1780 and 1910.



![F2.2](/img/f2.2.png "Share of nobility in Paris estates, 1780-1910")



This shows that it is possible for a small group individuals (names linked to the nobility represented barely 1-2% of the Parisian population during the period shown) to concentrate a considerable proportion of wealth, and consequently of economic and financial power. The graph proves how big an impact the decisions made during the French Revolution had on French society. The sudden drop (1780 - 1810) shows the immediate impacts of the wealth redistribution effected by the revolutionaries, and the subsequent rise is representative of the Restoration (1814-15), i.e. the period when the monarchy returned to France following the defeat of Napoleon’s armies by the European coalition of monarchies. There is, however, a general overall downward trend in the nobility’s position at the top of the wealth rankings, which is probably due to the renewing of elites, i.e. those who were able to take advantage of industrial and financial growth started to take their place.



After the Restoration of the monarchy, the “migrants’ billion”, as it was known, was a huge financial compensation package adopted in 1825 to compensate the nobles who had been forced to leave the country during the revolution. It transferred close to 15% of the country’s GDP to cover losses of land and losses in rent which would have been paid during the time away. This was entirely paid for by tax funds and borrowing on the public purse.



### The Church’s property before the French Revolution



The available sources indicate that in France, the Catholic Church held about 15% of land in the 1780s. If we add an estimated capitalised value of the tithe, we can consider that the Church’s possessions came to about 25% of everything in France. The estimates for the other European countries are roughly comparable. In Spain, the Church had 15% of all agricultural land available, with those lands returning 24% of total agricultural revenue due to their comparatively high agricultural quality. It’s a little more difficult to assign a value to the tithe in Spain, because the Church was at that time contributing variable proportions of its revenue to the Crown. These payments between from the Church to the Crown were initially credited as being for the contribution to the holy war against the Muslims to assure the Reconquista (re-conquering) of the country from 718 to 1492, but later on the payments continued for varying reasons even though the war was over.



Agricultural land represented at that time between half and two-thirds of the total value of all property (land, residential, warehousing and manufacturing buildings, and financial assets, net value after debt) in France, Spain and the UK in the 18th century. We know very little about the Church’s ownerships of assets besides land. Regarding some of these assets, recent research has shown that the Spanish Church had a significant foothold in mortgage credit (i.e. using land and/or buildings as collateral), going from 45% in the 17th century to 70% in the middle of the 18th. By combining these different sources, we can consider that the Church in Spain held about 30% of the total of all property in 1750. Another example is the Ethiopian Church, which held about 30% of land in Ethiopia around 1700.



The general point we are making is that when an organisation controls such a high proportion of assets in a country, it has considerable financial and human influence to structure and regulate that society, in particular by paying a numerous clergy and developing multiple services and activities, for example in education and sanitation. This is not a hegemonic power, unlike for example in Communist states during the Soviet era (which controlled around 70-90% of assets). The Christian Church was an important actor in a pluralist political system, as we have explained: the trifunctional system. Nevertheless, its position as number one owner in Christian kingdoms (no noble individuals owned as much as the Church, not even the king) gave it a capacity for action which was often superior to that of the State itself.



For comparison, in the present day, all non-profit institutions combined (including non-religious: universities, museums, hospitals, etc) own 1% in France, 3% in Japan and 6% in the US. The Chinese Communist Party, through the Chinese State, owns about 30% of all property in China. The CCP and the pre-Industrial Revolution Church are very different organisations, but they both had very ambitious projects for the development and guidance of society, and these projects can only be successfully executed with a solid capital base.



### Development of legal frameworks to control assets; and the Church’s gradual acceptance of financial instruments



The Church played a big role in the creation of a legal framework and legal institutions to protect its assets and provide adequate guarantees in the face of changing monarchs and private contractors.



In medieval Christian doctrine the problem was not, as we might imagine, that capital produced revenue without work: this unavoidable reality is the foundation of ecclesiastical property (as well as all property) -- it’s because of this that priests are able to carry out their duties without labouring. The problem is regarding the regulation of the methods of investment and holding of property that were to be deemed acceptable, to insure that capital was being utilised in the best way, and above all to direct the usage of that wealth in conformity with the Church’s social and political aims, as assigned by Christian doctrine. Receiving rent from land did not seem to pose any moral or conceptual difficulty, however, knowing where to draw the line outside of the domain of real estate was more tricky.



Pope Innocent IV, in the 13th century, explained in one of his writings that the problem was not usury itself, but the risk that returns from usury could prove too attractive to investors who would therefore not invest in more risky ventures, like for example animals and tools for the cultivation of land, which are indispensable to increase real wealth. His conclusion was that the rate of interest should not go above a certain threshold. A central banker in the modern age would follow the exact same reasoning in case of a drop in investments in the real economy, reducing interest rates in order to boost capital flows towards productive output.



During this time we also see new financial techniques being developed which began to operate as exceptions to the aforementioned rules. Sales through annuities or on credit was no longer considered usurious, as long as the circulation of goods could be qualified by Christian doctrine as being for the greater good. There were occurrences of Jews and other non-Christians being expropriated because they were deemed to be unable to understand the significance of wealth and the correct way in which to use it, as new credit techniques became legitimately open to Christians. The “trust”, a property construct allowing the separation of the identity of the beneficiary from the trust manager (*trustee*), has origins going back to the 13th century when Franciscan monks either couldn’t, or preferred not, to appear as direct owners of property.



This effort of legal abstraction, conceptualisation and formalisation of economic and financial ideas was especially necessary as the clerical class was not a hereditary one, but a abstract and perpetual organisation (like a modern foundation, business, company or state administration). In Hinduism or Islam, temples and pious foundations were not absent, but they went hand in hand with powerful hereditary clerical classes, so that power over property could rely on personal and family networks, which meant that the need to codify and formalise economic and financial relations was much less strong. On this point: Gregorian reforms of the Church (by Pope Gregory VII) in the 11th century made celibacy compulsory (up to this point, priests often had wives, and this had been widely tolerated in western Catholic regions of Europe), and this move could be seen as a way of enforcing the Church organisation as owner and avoid a drift towards a familial and hereditary entity.
