### 3 functions: clergy, nobility, third estate

Ternary societies are the oldest and most widespread type of regime that can be categorised as an unequal society. There are three distinct social groups: the clergy, the nobility and the third estate. The clergy is the religious and intellectual class: they give spiritual direction, values and education to the community. The nobility is the warrior and military class: it wields weapons and brings security, protection and stability to society as a whole; avoiding permanent chaos and generalised banditry. The third estate is the common and working class: all the rest of society, including peasants, artisans and merchants; through its work, it allows the entire community to feed itself, clothe itself and reproduce itself. We can also refer to other societies which have this original schema as a basis, but may in practise have many subclasses of varying complexity and diversity, as “ternary societies”. 

We find this type of general social organisation not only in all of christian Europe until the French revolution, but also in many societies outside of Europe and in most religions, especially in the case of Hinduism and Sunni or Shia islam. The ternary schema is found in almost all ancient societies and in every part of the world including the far east, China and Japan with, however, some substantial variations which we will be studying.

### Ternary societies and the creation of the modern State

Ternary societies are distinguished from later forms of society by two essential characteristics, which are closely linked: on one hand the ternary schema of the justification of inequality; on the other hand the fact that these are ancient societies which precede the creation of a modern centralised State, and in which the inseparable political and economic power was initially exerted on a local level, usually in a small territory, sometimes with relatively weak links to a more or less distant central monarchic or imperial power. The social order was structured around a few key institutions (the village, the rural community, the castle, the fort, the church, the temple, the monastery), in a strongly decentralised fashion, with limited coordination between different territories and power hubs. These hubs were usually badly connected, given the poor means of transport available, among other things. This decentralisation of power does not prevent brutality and domination in social relations, but it does mean that the ways in which it occurs differ to that of the centralised state structure of the modern age.

In practical terms, property rights and regal duties were inextricably linked with regards to the relations of power at the local level. The two leading classes -- the clergy and the nobility -- are property-owning classes. In particular, in general they own the majority of all agricultural land, the possession of which is the base of economic and political power in all rural societies. In the case of the clergy, ownership is usually organised through the intermediary of multiple forms of ecclesiastical institutions (churches, temples, diocese, pious foundations, monasteries, etc.) observed in the different religions, in particular in Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. In the case of the nobility, ownership is closer to the level of individual ownership, or rather on the level of lineage and title.

The important point is that the clergy’s and nobility’s property rights go hand in hand with essential regal powers, notably in terms of law and order and military power (normally the warrior nobility’s prerogative, but can also be wielded in the name of an ecclesiastical lord), as well as in terms of jurisdictional power (justice is normally served in the name of the local lord, either noble or religious). In medieval Europe as well as in pre-colonial India, the French *seigneur*, English *landlord*, Spanish *obispo*, Indian *brahman* or *rajput*, and their equivalents in other regions, were at the same time masters of the land and masters of the people who lived and worked on it. They were possessors of both property and regal rights, according to their respective contexts. 

Whether the lord was from the warrior or clerical class, whichever location we study in Europe, India, or other geographical areas, we notice in all ancient ternary societies the importance and deeply-rooted nature of these power relations at the local level. This sometimes takes the extreme form of forced labour and serfdom, which implies a strict limit to the freedom of movement of all or part of a class of workers: these may therefore not leave their land and work elsewhere. In this sense, they belong to the noble or religious lords, even if the ownership relation is different to that between a slave and their owner. 

More generally, worker management can be less extreme and potentially more benevolent, but nevertheless real, which can take the form of quasi-States at the local level, run by the clergy or nobility, with variable sharing of roles in each case. Apart from police and judicial power, the most important forms of management in traditional ternary societies include the control and registering of marriages, births and deaths. It is an essential service for the perpetuation and regulation of the community, closely tied to religious ceremonies and rules concerning matrimonies and recommended forms of family life (in particular all that relates to sexuality, paternal power, the role of women and the education of children). This is generally the role taken by the clerical class, and the corresponding registers are kept in churches and temples of the religion concerned. 

We must also mention the registering of transactions and contracts. This service is central to the regulation of economic activity and property relations, and can be exercised by the noble or religious lord, generally including the exercise of local jurisdictional power and the final say on civil, commercial and inheritance disputes. Education, medical care and certain collective infrastructure (mills, bridges, roads, wells) can also play an important part in the traditional ternary society. We should note that the regal powers held by the two first orders of ternary society (the clergy and nobility) are thought of as being the natural compensation received for the services which they provide to the third order in terms of security and spirituality, and more generally in terms of structuring the community. In the trifunctional society, each group takes its place in a structure of rights, duties and powers tightly bound to each other at the local level.

To what degree is the development of the modern centralised State responsible for the disappearance of ternary societies? We will see that the interactions between these two fundamental political-economic processes are in reality more complex, and cannot be described in a mechanical, unidirectional or determinist way. In certain cases, the trifunctional ideological schema can even manage to durably survive on top of a centralised state structure and can redefine and perpetuate itself in this new framework, at least for some time. We can think of, for example, the UK’s House of Lords, an institution for nobles and clergy which issued directly from the trifunctional medieval world, but played a central role in the government of the first global colonial empire during the majority of the 19th century and until the beginning of the 20th. We can also cite the Iranian Shia clergy, which, with the creation of the Guardian Council of the Constitution and the Assembly of Experts (members of which are elected, but must be clerical, this house chooses the Supreme leader) has managed to constitutionalise its dominant political role with the creation of the Islamic Republic at the end of the 20th century, an almost unheard of régime type in history, which is still in place at the time of writing in the early 21st century.

### The delegitimisation of ternary societies, between revolutions and colonisations

The construction of the modern State naturally tends to sap the foundations of the trifunctional organisational model of society, and is generally accompanied by the development of competing ideologies, for example the proprietary, colonialist and communist ideologies, which usually end up replacing or completely wiping out the ternary ideology as the dominant ideology. As soon as a centralised state structure manages to guarantee the security of people and goods on a large-scale territory, while mobilising an administration and specific human means (police, military, officers), which are decreasingly linked to the old warrior nobility, it’s clear that the nobility’s legitimacy as guarantor of order and security is strongly tested. In the same way, when civil, academic and university-level processes and institutions begin to develop with the aim of educating and producing new knowledge and wisdom, led by a new network of teachers, intellectuals, doctors, scientists and philosophers, decreasingly linked to the old clerical class, then it becomes clear that it’s the legitimacy itself of the clergy as guarantor of the community’s spiritual direction that is put into question. 

Such processes of delegitimisation of the old warrior and clerical classes can occur in a very gradual way, and in certain cases be spread over several centuries. In many European countries (for example the United Kingdom and Sweden), the transformation of trifunctional order societies into societies of proprietors has played out as a very long and progressive evolution, which began around 1500-1600 (or earlier) and ends only around 1900-1920; it is still not quite complete, since there are still traces of the trifunctional order to this day, if only in the form of the monarchic institution, still present in a large number of western European states, sometimes with largely symbolic remainders of noble or clerical power (like the British House of Lords). 

There are also moments of brutal acceleration, when novel ideologies and appropriate state structures act together to radically and consciously transform the organisation of the old ternary societies. One of the most emblematic cases of this is the French Revolution.

### Ternary societies in the modern day

Before going on further, we should answer a question we might naturally have: apart from historical curiosity, why should we study ternary societies? The structure of inequality in ancient ternary societies is not as far from the inequality manifested in modern society as you might think. And, the conditions of the disappearance of the trifunctional order being extremely variable from place to place, depending on religious, colonial and post-colonial contexts, have left deep marks on the world of today. 

First of all we should point out that even if rigidity of social status is the norm in the trifunctional schema, mobility between classes was in reality never totally absent, and on this point can appear similar to modern societies. It was probably quantitatively lower than it is now, however, the historical evidence that is available suggests that the mixing between classes was sufficiently large that any supposed differences used to legitimise the separation between the classes would have disappeared almost entirely after a few generations. In all trifunctional societies, even those where the religious class is in theory hereditary, we find clerics originating from the other two classes, workers ennobled after distinguishing themselves in combat or with their other merits or qualities, religious orders taking up arms, and so on. Social identity and boundaries between classes are negotiated and disputed, in ternary societies as in others. 

### On the justification of inequality in ternary societies

More generally, we would be mistaken to see in ternary societies the incarnation of an intrinsically unjust order, despotic and arbitrary, in radical opposition to the modern meritocratic order, reputedly just and harmonious. The need for security and direction have always been essential to societies. This is true even for less developed societies characterised by broken-up territory, poor communications and marked by chronic instability and precarious living conditions, whose foundations can be endangered in permanence by bandits, deadly raids or epidemics. When answers to these problems are given, those who provide them are, not surprisingly, successful in receiving popular support.

The distribution of power and resources between the three groups in the trifunctional schema can prove a problem. Trifunctional societies are often authoritarian, hierarchical and violently inegalitarian, allowing religious and military elites to maintain their dominant positions. They can sometimes go too far in their demands to the third order and overestimate their power of coercion, which can lead to revolts, to their transformation or disappearance. The core tenet that the three separate class groups are necessary for the continued subsistence of the society must maintain a minimum of plausibility in order for the society to continue coexisting peacefully. As in all societies, the inegalitarian regime can only survive with a combination of coercion and consent. Pure coercion is not enough: the model of social organisation put forward by the dominant groups must have a minimum of support from the population, or from a significant part of it. There must be a credible theory explaining why the regime currently in place is in the general public interest. For example, the story of the USA’s global military dominance, or previously that of the British Empire.

In the modern day, the equality of access to any job role in all sections or classes of society is touted as a core principle. We will investigate to what degree this claim is backed up by reality. 

### Multitude of elites, unity of the people?

There is a specific element of the European trifunctional order that differs to that in other parts of the world, and which may have affected its economic and financial trajectory. That element is the celibacy of priests in the Catholic Church, and as a result the distinctive process of reproduction of the clerical class in Europe. In contrast to hinduism, islam and judaism, catholic clergy must continually be fed by the other two classes of society (in reality by the nobility for the high clergy, and by the third estate for the rest of the clergy). In the next chapter we will examine how \[this distinguishing feature came to be at the origin of the most sophisticated legal system in the world]*, a legal system which has hugely assisted the West in its economic domination of the planet.

In Europe, the unification of status within the worker class and the gradual extinction of serfdom took almost a millenium, starting around the year 1000 and continuing until the end of the 19th century on the east side of the continent, which has left traces and discriminations which are visible to this day (as can be seen in the case of the Roma people).
